# tws-web

Misc web utils that do not fit tws-lts and tws-lts-react. They cover more stuff, but may change more frequently as well.

It also has some utils for easier bootstrap integration with styled-components.

It's tied to react, despire the fact that it does not has to be, as most of the apis do not really use react, however all the web apps I develop use react, so there is no reason for me not to use react here.
